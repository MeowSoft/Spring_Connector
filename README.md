## Spring connector

A device to quickly create a secure, temporary connection between multiple wires up to 12 AWG in size.

BOM:

3D printed parts,  
Spring - extension type, 3/8" x 2" x 0.035"  
Nylon screws - #10-32 x 1/2" (x2)  
Nylon hex nuts = #10-32 (X2)

Notes:  
-The screw holes in the models for the body pieces have a 0.3mm membrane across them. I find this makes the holes cleaner when printing with or without support. This membrane is thin  enough to equate to one layer of material on my printer and I just cut the hole out with an exacto knife. The model can easily be updated to remove this membrane if needed.

-This device could be adapted to any size spring.  

-Metal screws and nuts could be used, but the one that holds the spring in place would be live with whatever voltage is passing through the device.

Assembly:

Put the hex nuts and the screws in the body pieces.  
Attach the spring to the thumb piece.
